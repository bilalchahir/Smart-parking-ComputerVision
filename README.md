# Smart-parking-ComputerVision
The project "Smart-parking-ComputerVision" harnesses the power of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to analyze and process parking spots.

Here's an expanded explanation:

Computer Vision: This is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand the visual world. In the context of this project, computer vision algorithms are employed to process images or video footage of parking lots, identifying and analyzing parking spots.

AI Techniques: Artificial intelligence techniques, which include machine learning algorithms, are used to make sense of the data collected through computer vision. These techniques allow the system to learn from the images or video feeds, recognize patterns, and make decisions based on the detected parking spots.

Analyze and Process Parking Spots: The primary objective of the project is to analyze parking spots in real-time or from recorded footage. This involves tasks such as:

Detecting the presence of vehicles in parking spots.
Identifying whether a parking spot is occupied or vacant.
Providing insights such as the number of available parking spots in a parking lot.
Potentially integrating with other systems to facilitate smart parking management, such as guiding drivers to available spots or optimizing parking space utilization.
